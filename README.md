# self_similar

This document is about number series. Its purpose is simply to offer an insight into Tom Johnson's ideas on regard to pattern generation and organisation by means of the SuperCollider programming language.

My intention while writing was simply to understand better what I was reading in "Self-Similar Melodies" and to distract myself from the many urgent things that need to be done in my life, and that I keep procrastinating.

From this follows that this is not a paper on theory, or aesthetics, or mathematics or even programming, although directly or indirectly deals with these with more or less emphasis. This little manual was made just for fun, and hopefully will be read in the same way.

Try out every serie and feel free to bend it, twist it and/or to change it for your musical or non-musical needs. Keep in mind that these are numbers, and do not have to be used in the context of pitch, rhythm or music necessarily.
